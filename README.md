# cricketbot
This miniature high speed bot was developed as a mechanical prey agent for a live rodent predator, utilized for behavior research at the Northwestern MacIver Lab. Connects to a desktop client for advanced control commands and alignment with a habitat computer vision system.

This project is the culmination of Parker Ryan's undergraduate research in autonomous navigation, control theory, timing precision in embedded software instructions, and minimalist networking.
